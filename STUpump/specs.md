## Setting-up MS SQL Server Express Edition

For tests, we are using [Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express) which is free to use; alternatively, everything should work with minimal changes for other SQL Servers such as MySQL and MariaDB.
