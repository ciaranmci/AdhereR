# STUpump

This is a **use** of `AdhereR` (in the sense that the development here should not change the package itself but only use it to achieve specific goals) and is **not** intended to become a package itself.

More precisely, it implements an off-line pre-coded processing of a set of patients for which a pre-established set of CMAs and plots are generated and stored for later used. This model is rather general, but here it is developed specifically for `STU`.
