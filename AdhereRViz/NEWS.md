# AdhereRViz 0.2.1

In sync with `AdhereR` 0.7.1:

- allows the plotting of event intervals and gaps also for sliding windows and per episodes (controlled from Aesthetics -> Event intervals; by default not shown).

Small bug fixes.


# AdhereRViz 0.2

In sync with `AdhereR` 0.7, implements medication groups and `maximum.permissible.gap.append.to.episode` for `CMA_per_episode`, plus some small bug fixes and enhancements.


# AdhereRViz 0.1

This is the initial release, splitting the interactive visualisation (in this package) from the core computation of adherence and the generation of the plots (in package `AdhereR`).
