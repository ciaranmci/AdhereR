Please note that this release is the first to split the old AdhereR package into two parts: the "base" AdhereR (this package) and the interactive plotting (as a new package, AdhereRViz) that contains all the extra dependencies and code needed just for the interactive plotting.

Thus, because AdhereR *suggests* AdhereRViz, which is not yet on CRAN, a NOTE is generated.
Conversely, AdhereRViz might complain that the *required* minimum version of AdhereR (0.6) is not yet on CRAN...

Thnk you in advance for your understanding,
Dan
